I made this project in the Orcad program.The project aims to design a temperature control system in an enclosure. The temperature sensor used can measure the temperature linearly in the range +10...+90 degrees Celsius, the system will be designed so that the temperature in the room is maintained in the range +25...+75 degrees Celsius. The temperature sensor will be polarized in the current. The linear variation of the electrical resistance of the sensor with temperature is 24k - 84k and must be converted to a voltage variation in the range [0รท20V)]. In the premises, the temperature is maintained in the specified range with the help of a thermal plant controlled by a comparator and a relay. The central thermal-relay assembly will be modeled with the help of a resistor. The status of the unit (on/off) is signaled by a green LED. 
With the help of simulations in Orcad, I checked if the results after the calculations made by me are correct.
